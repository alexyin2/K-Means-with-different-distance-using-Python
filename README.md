# Learning K-means in Python without using sklearn

* **Warning**: 
 Â   - The code still has some problem when running the loop.
    - It sometimes will have a RunTimeError, but it doesn't effect the outcome I guess.

* I'm using Python to define different distance and run K-Means without using packages since it helps a lot in understanding the mathematics behind.

* Here, I've defined several different distances:
  1. Euclidean
  2. Manhattan
  3. ChebyShev distance
  4. A new distance defined by myself using weights which is decided based on domain knowledge.
  
* I've also done some data visualization at the beggining and look at the clusters I've generated.

* **Improvements for this repository**:
  - Data visualization should be clearer for showing the cluster outcome
  - Better introduction of the distance defined by myself
  - The way of choosing the first centroids can be improved
