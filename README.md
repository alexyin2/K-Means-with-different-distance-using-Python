# K-Means-with-different-distance-using-Python
I'm using Python to define different distance and run K-Means without using packages.
Honestly, the code still has some problem when running the loop. It sometimes will have a RunTimeError, but it doesn't effect the outcome I guess.
It would be glad if anyone can help with the code.
Here, I've define Euclidean, Manhattan, and ChebyShev distance.
I've also done some data visualization at the beggining and look at the clusters I've generated.
